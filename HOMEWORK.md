Your homework is to reverse engineer the hw.class file (you probably won't ever have to do this in real life cause Java programs usually aren't your target.)
Use the JD-GUI that is included in the repo.
Challenge: Don't use JD-GUI and figure out how compiled java code is organized!
Spaghetti code was used to confuse you. It won't confuse the decompiler though.
