6:33-7:03:
  - Continued research on the compiling process.
    - Semantic Analysis, Intermediate Code Generation, Optimization, Code Generation.

### 5/27:

##### Adnan:
2:54-3:35:
  - Found common tools used for software reverse engineering, researched them.
  - Began putting research onto PRESENTATION.md.

### 5/29:

##### Adnan:
1:30-7:30:
  - Continued putting research onto PRESENTATION.md.
  - Tried formatting research as I went.

### 5/30:

##### Adnan:
7:30-8:30:
  - Finished putting most of the research onto PRESENTATION.md.

##### William:
5:00-11:47:
  - Finished making demos and hw. Added leftover research about tools. Tried IDA over weekend, but freeware doesn't let me decompile .class files. Uploaded .jar file of JD-GUI to demo in class if it works.
